    Nowhere else in the world can you watch kangaroos hop across beautiful pastures, spot koalas sleeping in gum trees or snorkel with schools of fish on the Great Barries Reef. See saltwater crocodiles in their natural habitat, snap a selfie with a quokka or swim with Australian fur seals in wildlife experiences you won’t find anywhere else.

		<h4>whale sharks and humpbacks</h4>
		<p>
            About halfway up the West Australian coastline, Ningaloo Marine Park is the only place on the planet where large numbers of whale sharks are known to reliably visit so close to land. Join a one-day marine tour in holiday towns of Exmouth or Coral Bay from April to July and snorkel alongside these 14-metre (46-foot) harmless vegetarians. Western Australia's whale sharks share the warm waters with tropical fish, manta rays, turtles, dolphins and whales, and from July to October, you can also swim with migrating humpback whales off Ningaloo Reef. These gentle whales are also found migrating along the coast of Queensland between July and November, known as the ‘Humpback Highway’ among locals, offering another chance to see them up close.

		<h4>koalas</h4>
		<p>
            Victoria's Great Ocean Road is one of Australia's most breathtaking drives. It winds along the state's south-west coast, taking in cliffs, forests, hairpin bends and seaside towns. It also leads to clusters of grey koalas, hidden high in the treetops. The best place to find them is along Lighthouse Road, Cape Otway, which diverts off the scenic route about 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the town of Apollo Bay. Koalas are everywhere, but they're well camouflaged, so you may not see them at first. Train your eyes and soon you'll be spotting them like a pro. Here's a tip: don’t stop at the first bunch of cars parked beneath a tree – just beyond you should get koalas all to yourself.

			<h4>Kangaroos</h4>
			<p>
                It’s an unusual sight, and one you're not likely to forget. The eastern grey kangaroos at Pebbly Beach, on the South Coast of New South Wales, love to relax and soak up the sunshine. You'll see them in large numbers on the grass and sand. Many of them at the popular surfing and bushwalking spot, about 270 kilometres (168 miles) south of Sydney, don't mind posing for photographs either. In Western Australia, head to Lucky Bay (just a 40-minute drive from Esperance) to see them lounging on the white sands, while in Queensland you’re guaranteed to spot ‘roos and wallabies on the beach at Cape Hillsborough, near Mackay.

				<h4>Sea turtles</h4>
				<p>
                    When you snorkel over the coral gardens of the Great Barrier Reef, you may feel as though your mask isn't big enough to take everything in. Just off the sandy shores of Lady Elliot Island, a coral cay at the southern end of the World Heritage-listed reef, sea turtles flit through the aquamarine waters. You'll likely encounter them along one of the many snorkelling trails, which you can swim on your own using a free map, or by joining a guided snorkel safari. The lagoon on the eastern side of the island is particularly rich with sea life. If you've never snorkelled before, you can take one of the island's free lessons. If you'd rather stay dry, jump aboard the glass-bottomed boat for views of tropical fish and colourful corals.
